# FG-2.0
FG 2.0 (Flight Group 2.0) is a flight booking system that uses a calendar to organize large travel groups.

### How it Works
User A creates the group channel and sets the departure and arrival days for their flight. Users B, C, D, E, F, and G can join the group and view days selected by User A. They can also propose their own departure and arrival days. Based on all the gathered information, the calendar will use a color system to show which days are best for everyone.

### Color Meaning
- Green (A lot of people can go)
- Yellow (Not that many people can go)
- Red (No one can go)
