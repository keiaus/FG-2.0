# FG-2.0
FG 2.0 (Flight Group 2.0) is a flight booking system that uses a calendar to organize large travel groups.

How it Works
---
User A creates the group channel and sets the departure and arrival days for their flight. Users B, C, D, E, F, and G can join the group and view days selected by User A. They can also propose their own departure and arrival days. Based on all the gathered information, the calendar will use a color system to show which days are best for everyone.

The Idea Behind FG-2.0
---
The general idea is to make traveling with large groups of people easy. Let's say you have a party of about 15 people you'd like to go on a trip with. Instead of having to message them individually with all the flight info, you can just use Flight Group to create a group channel. Each group channel will show all the flight details and will have a calendar system that shows which day ranges are perfect, not so good, and completely bad for everyone.
